# ARC-SPACE
ARC SPACE is a simple but fun game where you control a little spaceship and your only mission is not to crash with the asteroids.
The asteroids appear randomly, and as you survive longer, the game gets faster and harder. Every 10 asteroids, the speed goes up a bit, so you have to react quicker each time.
I built the game using sprites for the ship and the asteroids, working with masks, rotation, and collision detection. This helped me understand how sprite-based movement and animations work inside Pygame.
This is my first time using Pygame, and I learned a lot while creating this little project — especially generating obstacles randomly and controlling the physics of the ship.
